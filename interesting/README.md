# interesting, but useless

This has been going on for a while … I invent some useless but interesting
thingy, can't think of any way to make it applicable to what I was actually
working on, … then … what? Do I just chuck it? Might I think of some way to use
it later?

Sometimes I try to bury these in the git history by issuing a commit and then
another commit to just remove it back out. Instead, maybe I just have a snippit
dir? `examples/`? Is that better?
